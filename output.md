## Output

Anticipated deliverables from the workshop include an archival workshop report (to be openly published) summarizing the activities, and a jointly authored editorial or perspective paper submitted to a domain journal such as _Combustion and Flame_.

In addition, any recommendations related to cultural issues will be communicated to the Combustion Institute, for example through an open letter. The Combustion Institute is the primary professional society of researchers in combustion and related fields.
